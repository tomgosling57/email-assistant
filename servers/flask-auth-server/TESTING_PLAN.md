# E2E Test 404 Error Resolution Plan

## Problem Statement
The end-to-end tests in `servers/flask-auth-server/tests/test_e2e_auth.py` are failing with a 404 status code, indicating that the test client cannot reach the Flask server or the endpoints are incorrect.

## Investigation Summary
The primary reason for the 404 errors is likely that the Flask server is not running or not accessible in the way the `requests` library expects during the execution of the E2E tests. Relying on an external server for E2E tests can lead to inconsistencies and setup complexities.

## Proposed Solution Plan

### 1. Ensure Flask Server is Running and Accessible During Testing
Instead of relying on an externally running Flask server, we will integrate the Flask application directly into the `pytest` test suite using Flask's built-in test client. This ensures the application is running within the test environment and is accessible to the tests, eliminating the need for manual server management and ensuring a consistent test environment.

### 2. Modify `servers/flask-auth-server/tests/test_e2e_auth.py`

#### 2.1. Create a `pytest` fixture for the Flask app and test client
A new `pytest` fixture will be introduced to handle the creation and configuration of the Flask application in a testing context. This fixture will yield a test client that can be used to make requests directly to the Flask application.

#### 2.2. Configure the Flask app for testing
Within the new fixture, the Flask application will be configured specifically for testing. This includes setting `app.config['TESTING'] = True` and potentially configuring a separate test database to ensure test isolation and prevent interference with development or production data.

#### 2.3. Replace `requests.post` calls with the Flask test client
All existing `requests.post` calls in `test_e2e_auth.py` will be replaced with calls to the Flask test client. The test client allows direct interaction with the Flask application without needing to make actual HTTP requests over the network, which will make tests faster and more reliable.

#### 2.4. Implement proper database setup and teardown
The `setup_users` fixture currently has commented-out database cleanup logic. This logic will be uncommented and fully implemented using the `MongoDBClient` to ensure a clean state for the 'users' collection before and after each test run. This is crucial for repeatable and reliable tests.

### 3. Required Setup/Teardown Procedures
The new `pytest` fixture will encapsulate all necessary setup and teardown procedures:
*   **Setup:** Creating and configuring the Flask application, initializing the test client, and connecting to a dedicated test database (if applicable).
*   **Teardown:** Cleaning up the test database by deleting any users created during the tests to ensure a pristine state for subsequent test runs.

## Next Steps
Once this plan is approved, the next step will be to switch to code mode to implement the changes in `servers/flask-auth-server/tests/test_e2e_auth.py` and potentially `servers/flask-auth-server/app.py` and `servers/flask-auth-server/auth.py` as needed.
